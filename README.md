## The continuation will be "Web_Security_Awareness_V1.06" (in progress)

This project focuses on implementing a secure device authentication system with AES encryption to ensure the safe transmission of data. The system allows users to authenticate using their device ID and token. Once authenticated, the system ensures that the device data is transmitted securely, preventing unauthorized access.

The HTML structure includes a simple yet effective form where the user can input the necessary credentials (device ID and token). Upon submitting the form, the system validates the credentials. If the authentication is successful, the user can send the device's data securely. 

To enhance security, the system uses AES encryption via the CryptoJS library to ensure that all data is encrypted before being sent. Any attempts to send unencrypted data trigger a warning message to notify the user about potential security risks.

This system is ideal for applications where secure device communication and data transmission are critical, such as IoT devices, secure server interactions, or any system that requires encrypted communication for privacy protection.
